  abstract =      {In a model calibrated to match micro- and
                   macroeconomic evidence on household income dynamics,
                   we show that a modest degree of heterogeneity in
                   household preferences or beliefs is sufficient to
                   match empirical measures of wealth inequality in the
                   United States. The heterogeneity-augmented model's
                   predictions are consistent with microeconomic
                   evidence that suggests that the annual marginal
                   propensity to consume (MPC) is much larger than the
                   roughly 0.04 implied by commonly used macroeconomic
                   models (even ones including some heterogeneity). The
                   high MPC arises because many consumers hold little
                   wealth despite having a strong precautionary motive.
                   Our model also plausibly predicts that the aggregate
                   MPC can differ greatly depending on how the shock is
                   distributed across households (depending, e.g., on
                   their wealth, or employment status).},
