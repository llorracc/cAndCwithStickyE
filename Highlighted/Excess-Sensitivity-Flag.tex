Despite generating appropriate aggregate smoothness, when estimated on simulated \emph{individual} data (corresponding to microeconomic evidence), regressions in the spirit of  \cite{dynanHabits} (the seminal paper in the micro `excess smoothness' literature) reproduce her finding that at the level of individual households, consumption growth has little predictability at the quarterly frequency -- \cite{dynanHabits}'s regressions typically get $\bar{R}^{2}$'s % JS changed to bar R, to be consistent with the discussion of the regression results below
 of about 0.01, and her largest reported value is 0.02, in the ballpark of the corresponding estimates generated by our model.\footnote{\hyperlink{Excess-Sensitivity}{Below} we explain why the \cite{hrsHabit} findings, and our model, are not in substantial conflict with the `excess sensitivity' literature---indeed, our model can explain some puzzles in that literature.}
