  Despite generating appropriate aggregate smoothness, when our model is estimated on simulated \emph{individual} data (corresponding to microeconomic evidence), regressions in the spirit of  \cite{dynanHabits} (the seminal paper in the micro `excess smoothness' literature) reproduce her finding that at the level of individual households, consumption growth has little predictability at quarterly frequency -- \cite{dynanHabits}'s regressions typically get $\bar{R}^{2}$'s % JS changed to bar R, to be consistent with the discussion of the regression results below
  of about 0.01, and her largest reported value is 0.02, in the ballpark of the estimates from corresponding simulated data generated by our model.
